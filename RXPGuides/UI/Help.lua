H["I'm missing a lot of exp, why?"] = [[
You should be grinding mobs between quests, not just moving from objective to objective.

This guide is based on speed - which means less quests to turn in. Grinding from quest to quest makes up for the lost xp.
]]

H["Why is my guide missing levels?"] = [[
The level ranges on our guides are intended for standard exp rates, do not worry about following the leveling brackets while on 20% or 50% exp.

Just follow the guide the best you can.
]]

H["Why is my guide skipping lots of steps or zones?"] = [[
These are inefficient areas that we skip if you are missing quest chains or if you are ahead in levels compared to the guide.
